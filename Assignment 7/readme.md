Documentation: <br> The jupyter notebook 'DA5401_A7_BE22B005.ipynb' contains my submission for all 4 parts of Assignment 7 of DA5401 for the Jul-Nov 2025 semester. In order to run, it requires the following python packages to be installed (using pip or any other python package manager): pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, xgboost and ucimlrepo. <br><br>
The Landsat Satellite Dataset Dataset used for this assignment has been sourced from: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/146/statlog+landsat+satellite <br>
As the dataset is sourced directly from the 'ucimlrepo' library, the code cells can be directly executed in order to replicate my results.
