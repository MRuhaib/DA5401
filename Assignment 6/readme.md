Documentation: <br> The jupyter notebook 'DA5401_A6_BE22B005.ipynb' contains my submission for all 3 parts of Assignment 6 of DA5401 for the Jul-Nov 2025 semester. In order to run, it requires the following python packages to be installed (using pip or any other python package manager): pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn and scikit-learn. <br><br>
The UCI Credit Card Default Clients Dataset used for this assignment has been sourced from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/default-of-credit-card-clients-dataset <br>
Download 'UCI_Credit_Card.csv' from this link and upload this dataset to the working directory of the notebook. Then, the code cells can be directly executed in order to replicate my results.
