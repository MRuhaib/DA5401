Documentation: <br> The jupyter notebook 'DA5401_A5_BE22B005.ipynb' contains my submission for all 3 parts of Assignment 5 of DA5401 for the Jul-Nov 2025 semester. In order to run, it requires the following python packages to be installed (using pip or any other python package manager): pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scipy and scikit-learn. <br><br>
The yeast gene expression dataset used for this assignment has been sourced from: http://sourceforge.net/projects/mulan/files/datasets/yeast.rar <br>
Download 'yeast.arff' from this link and upload this dataset to the working directory of the notebook. Then, the code cells can be directly executed in order to replicate my results.
